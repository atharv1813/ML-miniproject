# Uber Trip Data Clustering Project

This project focuses on analyzing Uber trip data to identify patterns and group similar trips using clustering techniques. The analysis is performed using Python, with the primary code contained in the Jupyter Notebook `uber-trips-clustering-final.ipynb`.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is `uber-data2.csv`, which contains records of Uber trips. Each record includes details such as:

- **Date/Time**: The date and time when the trip started.
- **Latitude**: The latitude coordinate of the trip's starting point.
- **Longitude**: The longitude coordinate of the trip's starting point.
- **Base**: The TLC base company code affiliated with the Uber trip.

## Data Preprocessing

Before applying clustering algorithms, the data undergoes several preprocessing steps to ensure its suitability for analysis:

1. **Loading the Data**: The dataset is loaded into a pandas DataFrame for easy manipulation.

2. **Data Cleaning**:
   - **Handling Missing Values**: Any records with missing values are identified and addressed. Depending on the extent and significance, missing values may be filled using appropriate imputation methods or the records may be removed.
   - **Data Type Conversion**: The 'Date/Time' column is converted to a datetime object to facilitate time-based analysis.

3. **Feature Engineering**:
   - **Extracting Time-Based Features**: From the 'Date/Time' column, additional features such as 'Hour', 'Day of Week', and 'Month' are extracted to capture temporal patterns in the data.
   - **Geospatial Features**: The 'Latitude' and 'Longitude' columns are retained as they are crucial for spatial clustering.

4. **Normalization**:
   - To ensure that all features contribute equally to the clustering process, numerical features are normalized. This is typically done using techniques like Min-Max scaling or Z-score normalization.

## Clustering Algorithms

The project explores two primary clustering techniques to group similar Uber trips:

### K-Means Clustering

**Overview**: K-Means is a partition-based clustering algorithm that divides the dataset into K distinct clusters based on feature similarity.

**Implementation Steps**:

1. **Choosing the Number of Clusters (K)**:
   - The Elbow Method is employed to determine the optimal number of clusters. This involves plotting the sum of squared distances from each point to its assigned cluster center and identifying the 'elbow point' where the rate of decrease sharply slows.

2. **Running the Algorithm**:
   - The K-Means algorithm is applied to the normalized feature set, initializing K cluster centers and iteratively updating them until convergence.

3. **Assigning Labels**:
   - Each trip is assigned to the nearest cluster center, effectively grouping trips with similar characteristics.

**Considerations**:
- K-Means assumes clusters are spherical and of similar size, which may not always be the case in real-world data.
- The algorithm is sensitive to the initial placement of cluster centers, so multiple runs with different initializations may be performed to achieve a stable solution.

### Hierarchical Clustering

**Overview**: Hierarchical clustering builds a multilevel hierarchy of clusters by either progressively merging small clusters into larger ones (agglomerative) or dividing large clusters into smaller ones (divisive).

**Implementation Steps**:

1. **Distance Metric**:
   - A suitable distance metric (e.g., Euclidean distance) is selected to measure the dissimilarity between trips.

2. **Linkage Criteria**:
   - The linkage criterion (e.g., single, complete, average) determines how the distance between clusters is computed during the merging process.

3. **Dendrogram Construction**:
   - A dendrogram is constructed to visualize the merging process and determine the optimal number of clusters by identifying significant gaps between successive merges.

**Considerations**:
- Hierarchical clustering does not require specifying the number of clusters in advance.
- It can capture complex cluster structures but is computationally more intensive than K-Means, especially for large datasets.

## Results and Visualization

The clustering results are visualized to interpret and validate the formed clusters:

- **Geospatial Plots**:
  - Scatter plots of trip starting points are colored based on their assigned clusters to observe spatial groupings.

- **Temporal Analysis**:
  - The distribution of trips across different times of the day, days of the week, and months is analyzed within each cluster to identify temporal patterns.

- **Cluster Profiles**:
  - Key statistics and characteristics of each cluster are summarized to understand the defining features of trips within each group.

## Conclusion

The clustering analysis reveals distinct patterns in Uber trip data, such as:

- Geographical hotspots where trips frequently originate.
- Peak hours and days with higher trip densities.
- Associations between specific TLC base companies and trip characteristics.

These insights can inform operational decisions, marketing strategies, and resource allocation for ride-sharing services.

## Future Work

To enhance the analysis, future work could include:

- **Incorporating Destination Data**: If available, including trip destination information could provide a more comprehensive view of travel patterns.

- **Predictive Modeling**: Developing models to predict trip demand based on historical patterns, weather data, and other external factors.

- **Real-Time Analysis**: Implementing real-time data processing to monitor and respond to emerging trends in trip data.
